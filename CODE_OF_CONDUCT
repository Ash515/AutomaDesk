## üí°Prop tip from the Project Admin (Me üòú)
- I am happy to provide you the points you need to reach the leaderboard, I look forward to give more points than needed if required, but the minimum I expect is your genuine interest to solve the issue and contribute.
- Want GSSoC points? Not the right place for you. Want to learn things and master git place for you, and forget about points you'll get more than expected
- I'm happy to help anyone who is really concerned in learning, _**but please don't spam 100s of project with your random message**_, Stick to 2-3 projects of your like and work on it.
- Didn't get any issue to work on? Just join the project's discord in readme. I'll help you find one :)
- Happy learning. Feel free to connect if you are concerned with learning and growing üòä
