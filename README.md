# AutomaDesk
A tool that organizes files and folders based on pre-defined rules. This can save time and effort spent on manually maintaining a clean desktop.

## **Features**
* **File Organization:**
    * Define rules to move files based on their extensions (e.g., move all `.txt` files to a "Documents" folder).
    * Save and manage these rules persistently using a SQLite database.
    * Organize files within a selected directory based on the defined rules.
* **File Renaming:**
    * Select and rename individual files.
    * Define patterns for renaming, including placeholders to dynamically insert parts of the original filename or extension.
* **Search:**
    * Search for files within a specific directory.

## **Requirements**
* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (included in most Python installations)
* sqlite (included in most Python installations)

## **Installation**
No installation is required. You can run the script directly from your command line.

## **Usage**
1. **Download:** Save the script `main.py` to your desired location.
2. **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
